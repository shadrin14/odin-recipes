    <h2>French crepes</h2>
    <p>A crêpe or crepe is a very thin type of pancake. Crêpes are usually one of two
        varieties: sweet crêpes (crêpes sucrées) or savoury galettes (crêpes salées).
        They are often served with a wide variety of fillings such as cheese, fruit,
        vegetables, meats, and a variety of spreads.[4] Crêpes can also be flambéed,
        such as in crêpes Suzette.
